Overview

This project is an automated cryptocurrency arbitrage bot designed to take advantage of price differences between multiple exchanges.
The bot connects to exchange APIs, continuously scans for opportunities, and executes trades when profitable spreads are detected.

Currently, the bot is in demo mode and supports Bitcoin (BTC) with real-time price tracking. Future versions will expand support to additional assets such as Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), and more trading pairs across different markets.
